Parflow-interface is a Matlab code design to to perform simulation on Parflow using Matlab as an interface to set parameter and data file. It also read the output and can plot some feature.

### What is in it ? ###

* code: This is the core code of the interface
* manual: Here are some manual I found (and one I wrote) to help to start with Parflow
* simulations: These are some exemple of simulations I run with Parflow-interface.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install Paflow on your system
* Create a new simulation
* Copy a "global_script.m" to your new simulation folder
* Set up and run your new global_script in matlab

### Contribution guidelines ###

* More than happy if someone want to use it. It's not very optimized or tested. I doubt it's very useful...

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Raphael Nussbaumer (rafnuss@gmail.com)
* This was created part of my Master Thesis from Imperial College London while Iwas hosted at University of Saskatewan.
